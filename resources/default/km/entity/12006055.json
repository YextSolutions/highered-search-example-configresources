    "description": "This course will explore the context, content, and significance of reparations. States deploy reparations to acknowledge and sometimes make restitution for institutionalized violence. Typically, reparations are won by activist-led movements. Conflicts may arise over who can speak for harmed groups and what constitutes justice. For their part, state actors may approach reparations strategically, e.g., to reframe a historical narrative. After studying various precedents, we will turn to recent developments in the long struggle for restorative justice for African Americans and other African diasporic communities worldwide.",
