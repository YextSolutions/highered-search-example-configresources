    "description": "This course invites students to study Teotihuacan, Mexico, the largest urban development of American antiquity. It considers this city\u0027s art history and archaeology over six weeks, to culminate in a 1-week fieldtrip to view the city\u0027s ruins, if possible. We will then examine those major pre-Hispanic polities with which Teotihuacan interacted, including Tikal, Guatemala, or upon which it exerted historical influence, such as Tenochtitlan, Mexico City. The final two weeks will consider comparative settlement and architectural data from the Mississippian, Puebloan, and Inka cultures of Indigenous North and South America.",
