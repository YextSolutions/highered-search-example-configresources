    "description": "Qu√© es una frontera? How has the US-Mexico border been configured and imagined since colonial times? What does it mean to live in-between nations, languages and worldviews? This seminar will explore the concept of the border and borderland spaces from a humanistic and historical perspective. We will reflect on the border as a geographical space but also as a discursive site where authors reflect on dreams, (land) struggles, trans-nationalism, language, identity, race, gender, and human rights. Some reading knowledge of Spanish is desirable but not required.",
