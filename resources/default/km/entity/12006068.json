    "description": "Sea Level Rise, Islands and the Environmental Humanities explores how islanders, predominantly but not exclusively in the Pacific and the Caribbean, are experiencing sea level rise and how they are engaging it in literature, art and film. Students in the seminar will also learn about the environmental science and policy related to sea level rise. They will consider solutions being put forward to address the impacts, such as managed retreat; hard engineering, such as building sea walls or artificial islands; or soft engineering, such as preserving and restoring natural buffers, be they coral or oyster reefs, mangrove marshes or wetlands.",
