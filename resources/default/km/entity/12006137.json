    "description": "In the second half of 2011, the crisis in the Eurozone threatened to run out of control. This course discusses four themes: 1) the critiques of the concept of the Eurozone prior to January 1999; 2) why the Eurozone appeared a major success at its 10th anniversary, which coincided with the beginning of the global economic crisis; 3) the interconnected nature of the crisis, weak sovereigns, weak banks, and weak growth prospects; and 4) the domestic and multilateral measures to deal with the crisis. The course also considers the future of the Eurozone.",
