    "description": "This laboratory course complements NEU 501A and introduces students to the variety of techniques and concepts used in modern neuroscience, from the point of view of experimental and computational/quantitative approaches. Topics include synaptic transmission and plasticity, two-photon imaging, central neuron activity patterns, optogenetic methods to control neural activity and student-designed special projects. In-lab lectures give students the background necessary to understand the scientific content of the labs but the emphasis is on the laboratory work. Second half of a double-credit core course required of all NEU Ph.D. students.",
