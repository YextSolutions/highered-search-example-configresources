    "description": "Why is it that we know something but don\u0027t act accordingly? This question becomes urgent in the face of issues that require immediate action, like global-warming, meat-production, exploitative working conditions, sexual violence, racism. \"\"Death is a master from Germany,\"\" the poet Paul Celan wrote - given the long denial of the death-camps, we could also say: \"\"Denial is a master from Germany.\"\" This class traces a series of catastrophic (quasi-)events in German history and discusses global analogues.
