    "description": "We will study the life and work of Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855). His mission as an author begins with a journal entry he wrote while overlooking the sea north of Copenhagen: \"\"What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose.\"\" We will follow in Kierkegaard\u0027s footsteps, both literally and figuratively.",
