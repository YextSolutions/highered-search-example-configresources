    "description": "Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun famously said: \"\"Women used to reign; the Revolution dethroned them.\"\" Did women enjoy greater power and agency in an aristocratic society? Did the attempt to install democracy result in a backward slide for women\u0027s rights? This course will examine these questions through one of the most significant cultural expressions in Early modern France: theater. We will study the representation of women on stage in the era from both a historical and a literary perspective, considering for instance the social status of actresses at the time as well as the depth of female roles in the extant repertoire.",
