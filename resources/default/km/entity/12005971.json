    "description": "The word \"\"sick\"\" means many things: \"\"I\u0027m sick,\"\" \"\"Out sick,\"\" \"\"That\u0027s sick,\"\" and \"\"Sick!\"\" What might the alternate connotations of the word \"\"sick\"\"--disturbing or cool--suggest about our relationship with its primary meaning of being ill? Illness narratives have often captivated our cultural imagination, yet these narratives have taken on a new urgency today as we navigate the COVID pandemic. This course will examine illness narratives--literature, films, TV shows--in order to see what it can tell us about our current moment. Our discussions will seek to understand illness with nuance and compassion towards ourselves, others, and our community.",
